This repo is where I've been playing around the NBA's great hot hand debate. 

[🏀 My initial analysis of some Kobe Bryant shot data is here](https://github.com/jessimk/hothand/blob/master/kobe_hothand_python.ipynb).

[🔥 I wrangled some shot streak data here](https://github.com/jessimk/hothand/blob/master/Streaky-ness.ipynb) from this [raw shot log data](https://github.com/jessimk/LBJ_Make_or_Miss/blob/master/data/shot_logs_raw.csv).

I also used this mini project to work on my dictionary and pandas skills. I'm hoping to add some hypothesis testing next as well as some interactive plots. 

( 🔨 Lots of the analysis is still in progress.)

Data:
- Kobe data from the `statsR` [package](https://github.com/StatsWithR/statsr/tree/master/data)
- Raw shot log data is for the 2014-2015 NBA Season and originally from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/nba-shot-logs/home).
